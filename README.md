# Maze


## How does ray casting work?
There are three main components:

- The player represented as a vector (x and y coordinates).

- The player's direction is represented as a vector (x and y coordinates).

- A camera plane, which represents the surface of the computer screen and is represented by a line (a single vector) that should always be perpendicular to the direction vector.


### FOV (Field Of Vision)
![Code](images/vec.png)
The FOV is determinated by the ratio of the length of the direction vector, and the length of the plane
Example:
